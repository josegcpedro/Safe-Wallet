## What i learn?

**Setup Simulator** first of all i installed "XCODE" and install the ios version going to the settings pressing cmd `âŒ˜ + ,`
After that i installed watchman, its a tool for watching file changes. Installing it results in a better perfomance. i installed it with: `brew install watchman`
Then running the application with `npx expo start` then opening with ***ios simulator***.
