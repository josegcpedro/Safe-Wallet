## What I Learned

### Setup Simulator

1. #### Install Xcode ####
   First, I installed **Xcode** and set up the **iOS version** by going to the settings and pressing `âŒ˜ + ,`
   
2. #### Install Watchman ####  
   Watchman is a tool for monitoring file changes, which improves performance.  
   Installation command:  
   ```bash
   brew install watchman
3. #### Launching app ####
    Then running the application with `npx expo start` and opening the ***ios simulator (i)***

### Setup Welcome page

1. #### Image Background ####
    First i choosed a image for my background, then i put it using `<ImageBackground source={HomeImage}`, HomeImage refers to a const that i created for redirecting the image `const HomeImage = require("../assets/images/rome.jpg")`
2. #### Image Background cover error ####
    I had a problem with the image, the size didn't cover all the phone, so i found a very useful code to resolve that
    `...StyleSheet.absoluteFillObject`, the command zooms the image to completly cover the phone.
3. #### Redirecting button to login page ####
    To do that, i start by importing userRouter `import { useRouter } from "expo-router";` then i create a onPress function,
    `onPress={() => router.push("/screens/login")}` so when i click the button it redirects me to /screens/login.
4. #### Styling the button ####
    I found some really cool css styles, like shadowColor, that is for ios and android.
    - IOS
        - shadowColor (shadow color)
        - shadowOffset (move x & y)
        - shadowOpacity (shadow opacity)
        - shadowRadius (blur)
    - Android
        - elevation (the bigger the number,bigger the shadow )

### Setup firebase 

1. #### Setup FireBaseConfig.ts
    First of all, after doing `npx expo install firebase` i created a file **fireBaseConfig.ts** and i put all the informations that firebase gived to me after i created the web app on firebase.
    Then i imported firebase auth and firebase store. and exported like the app, so i can use **FIREBASE_AUTH** when i want, and dont need to import all the times.
2. #### Metro.config.js
    It's a advanced configuration file for react native, it's for particulary needs.
